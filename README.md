OC Project 6

To properly install the frontend you will need to clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/dwj-projet6 and store it in the "frontend" folder.

Moreover, install npm and all required libraries.

Finally you will need a .env file containing your mongoDB link.

Eventually, enjoy yourself !
